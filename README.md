# Waisman-LEND-Infographic

## What is Long-Tern care study?
We want to learn about quality of life for individuals who receive adult long term care supports in Wisconsin. We will give a survey to gather this information. You can take the survey just one time or you can choose to take it once a year for five years so we can access changes over time.

## What are the files here for?
There is an InDesign file here which contains an infographic that ships out to the participants of the survey to let them know key findings.
